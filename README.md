# All-in-one branch
- Use a submit button which generates a "submit" event when clicked. Requires an event listener in JS.
- Use media query to add a breakpoint.
- Everything is included in a single HTML file:
  - DOM
  - CSS styles + media query (within `<head>`)
  - JavaScript at the bottom (DOM must be fully loaded first in order to use element ids)
